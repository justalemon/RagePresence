* [5mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/ragepresence)
* [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/justalemon/ragepresence) (experimental)

## Installation

Drag and drop all of the files inside of the 7z to the root of your game directory.

## Usage

After installing the Mod, you will see the Rich Presence information on Discord as long as you didn't had an application sending Rich Presence information before starting the game.
